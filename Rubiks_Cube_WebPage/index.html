			Rubiks Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik. After it's creation, it took Erno Rubik over a month to learn how to solve it. Once it was released in stores, it quickly became one of the hardest, yet fun and the most popular and iconic toy in the world. By January of 2009, the cube had already sold 350 million units and still continues to sell tons of units yearly.

			This uproar caused the birth of cubing. Cubing is the act of solving a cube as a hobby, typically pretty fast. This led to the creation of more types of cubes from as simple as 4x4 and 5x5 puzzles, to modifications and alterations of the cube itself called mods, or shape mods. Competitions were also introduced, and as more people got into cubing, people got faster too. The first ever world record was held by an American by the name Minh Thai, with a time of 22.95 seconds. The current world record is held by an American by the name of Patrick Ponce, with a time of 4.69 seconds. He is followed closely by Australian Feliks Zemdegs in second, with a time of 4.73, and Mats Valk from the Netherlands in third, with a 4.74 second solve.
