			Ever since the world of cubing blew up, there has been many types of puzzles based off of the cube itself. First, there came higher order versions of the rubiks cube. Examples include the 4x4 and 5x5. There were also some lower order versions like the 2x2 and even the 1x1.

			Shapemods were also slowly popularizing. Shape mods were originally made by individuals who somehow modified the cube to move, look, and solve differently from the normal cube. However now, this isnâ€™t really necessary anymore because many companies have began mass producing these puzzles. Some shape mods are simple, like the skewb, and is really easy to solve, whereas the axis cube is a more complicated and harder to solve. Some shape mods, like the skewb, were actually made into official puzzles, and can be used to compete in competitions. The Axis Cube did not have the same luck, but is still a fun puzzle to play with, and challenge your mind. The first picture below is of a skewb, and the other an axis cube.
