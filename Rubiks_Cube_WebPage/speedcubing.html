		<h1>Speedcubing</h1>
		<p>
			Speedcubing is the act of solving a Rubiks Cube, while being timed. The goal usually is to solve the cube as fast as possible, and then proceed to learn how to solve it faster. This became popular soon after the popularity of cubing, and cubing competitions grew. Almost everybody who was interested in solving the cube, wanted to be the fastest faster cuber, and wanted the world record. Though many were not able to get as far as they would have wanted, due to the high competition and even pressure, being able to speedsolve a cube in general was something worth bragging about, as only a small percentage of the world population can even solve a rubiks cube in general. Speedcubing continues to become more popular as the years go by, and people just keep getting faster and faster. Speedcubing, is also now more complex than before. Now, there are more algorithms that can be used, and a much bigger collection of cubes to choose from. These special cubes are called Speedcubes.

		<h2>Speedcubes</h2>
		<p>
			SpeedCubes are considered an important part of speedcubing, alongside the cubers skills. SpeedCubes are the same as  normal Rubiks Cubes, but they are slightly modified, so that they can be fast, and turn flexibly, so that cubers can turn the layers fast, and at what would seem like awkward angles, so that they can solve it as fast as possible. These cubes have been changed, altered, and modified over time to be able to give the best all around performance possible. This goes for all cubes from 2x2 and 4x4 puzzles, to even some shape mods. Majority of the best speed cubes are made by the same 2 or 3 companies. The most popular of these companies are Moyu, and Qiyi. Right now, as of the publication of this site, some of the best speed cubes available are  Moyu Aolong V2, the Qiyi Valk 3, the Moyu Wei Po, and the Moyu Aosu. The first 2 are 3x3 puzzles, the third is a 2x2, and the fourth is a 4x4.

		<h2>Speedcubers</h2>
		<p>
			Since we are talking about speedcubes, it would also be appropriate to talk about the best speedcubers in the world right now. One of the most influential cubers is a 21 year old Australian by the name of Feliks Zemdegs. He has placed first in over 390 competitions, and has over 110 world records in total.  Mats Valk, a friend of Feliks, is also a pretty influential cuber himself, and has had his own share of world records. He actually held the 3x3 world record before Feliks took it from him earlier this year.
